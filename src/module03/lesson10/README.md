<h5>What is the Adapter pattern?</h5>
<p>An adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. 
An Adapter pattern acts as a connector between two incompatible interfaces that otherwise cannot be connected directly. 
An Adapter wraps an existing class with a new interface so that it becomes compatible with the clientâ€™s interface.</p>
----------------------
<h5>What is the difference between Adapter and Decorator?</h5>
<p>Main difference is: Decorator is used to decorate individual objects at run-time. 
Adapter is used to add features to the class and therefore to ALL of its objects.</p>

<h5>When do we use the Composite pattern?</h5>
<p>The Composite Design Pattern is meant to "compose objects into a tree structure to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
Composite Pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly".</p>

<h5>Give an example of the Facade pattern.</h5>
<p>For example javax.faces.context.ExternalContext internally uses ServletContext, HttpSession, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, and so on.</p>
