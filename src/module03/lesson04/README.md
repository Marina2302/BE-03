<h5>What is Queue?</h5>
<p>Queue represents a data structure designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue, and elements removed from the beginning of the queue. It follows the FIFO or the First-In-First-Out principle.</p>
----------------------
<h5>What is the difference between a queue and a dequeue?</h5>
<p>Queue is a list where insertion is done at one end and removal is done at the other end. Dequeue is a list where every end supports insertion and removal.</p>
----------------------
<h5>What is the difference between the group of methods add(e), remove(), element() and offer(e), poll(), peek()?</h5>
<p>The Queue interface specifies that first group of methods will throws an exception if the operation fails, the other returns a special value (either null or false, depending on the operation).</p>
----------------------
<h5>How is the criterion by which the priority of the necessary processing in the PriorityQueue will be determined?</h5>
<p>The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to their natural ordering, or by a Comparator provided at queue construction time, depending on which constructor is used.</p>
